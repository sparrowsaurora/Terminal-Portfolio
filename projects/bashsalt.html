                A current free SaaP (Software as a Product) project im working
                on to help developers work more efficiently.<br />A play on
                words of Bassalt, this is a collection of extra commands and
                tools for bash to make my life a little easier.<br />I was
                frustrated with manually making file maps, not having quick
                access to a ToDo list, and typing in long commands, etc. so i
                made this.
