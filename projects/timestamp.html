                A simple unix timestamp display built in C++ for a friend. It
                displays the current raw unix timestamp on a small LCD screen.
                This project was my first real look into embedded systems and
                programming in C++ and it's built on a raspberry pi pico
                (rp2040). It's a fun little project to practice low-level
                programming and working with embedded systems.
